‎Hi li, I just wanted to tell you that I liked you but I'm not saying this for you to like me back, I just wanted it to tell you because it's been weighing on me. I admit I did miss you these past few days that you didn't talk to me but I'm not mad or sad cause maybe you're just busy with your life.
‎
‎Do you wanna know why I liked you? Hha I'm gonna tell you even though you don't care,  I also don't know, maybe because I feel safe with you, you make me smile that can reach in my ears, you make me giggle with just your short message, and we barely know each other but I feel like I've known you for so long. You're actually the first guy that I ever like and the first guy that I confess.
‎
‎I don't even know if you'll ever read this.
‎
‎But if you do... I just want you to know, I still think about you sometimes. But the universe just never gave us enough space to become "us."
‎
‎I just wonder... if we had met at a different point in life, would the ending have been different?
‎
‎Anyway, I hope you're doing okay, even though we're not in each other's lives anymore.
‎
‎I hope you the best li, I hope that you always put a smile on your face no matter what. Don't worry I don't like you anymore so you don't need to feel guilty about feelings haha. I'm always rooting for you even though I'm far, I also hope that you'll find someone that will love you for who you are.
‎
‎This is actually the last time I talked to you so I'm gonna say goodbye and thanks for being my friend and if one day I come to china, I hope our path would cross someday.💐 
‎
